Happy number generator – in ruby.
 
-          although you can find solutions to this online we’re really looking for your own take on this – something non-text book or quiz result ‘ish

-          It would also be nice to have this take in a number value to test up to so you can test up to 10000 or anything else

Write a program that tells whether a given integer is happy. A happy number is found using the following process: Take the sum of the squares of its digits, and continue iterating this process until it yields 1, or produces an infinite loop.

For example the number 7:


7^2 = 49

4^2 + 9^2 = 97

9^2 + 7^2 = 130

1^2 + 3^2 + 0^2 = 10

1^2 + 0^2 = 1
