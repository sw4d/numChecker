Happy number generator â€“ in ruby.

A simple code challenge I found somewhere or another.

Write a program that tells whether a given integer is happy. A happy number is found using the following process: Take the sum of the squares of its digits, and continue iterating this process until it yields 1, or produces an infinite loop.

For example the number 7:


7^2 = 49

4^2 + 9^2 = 97

9^2 + 7^2 = 130

1^2 + 3^2 + 0^2 = 10

1^2 + 0^2 = 1
